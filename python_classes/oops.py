# OOPS:
# what ?
# why?
# how?
# Object Oriented Progamming


#functional/procedural based programming

# scalability issues

# c=( x for x in range(1,11))
# print(c)

#OOPS concepts
# class 
# object 
# inheritance
# encapsulation 
# polymorphism
# abstraction 



# classroom-class 
# board 
# chairs 
# teacher/trainer 
# teacher table
# students

# laptop:
# display
# keyboard 
# memory 
# processor

# class:
    # it is  a blueprint / template for creating objects 
# object:
    #14" -fhd diplay
    # backlit keyboard
    #16gb ram 1tb storage 
    #i9 
# it is  defined as a instance of a class 

# class- human 
# two legs 
# two hands
# one head 
# they can speak


# inheritance:
# it is getting /accessing propties of a class in another class



#encapsulation
# wrapping different methods or properties into a single unit is called encapsulation 


#polymorphism
# poly -many 
# morphism-- taking  a differet form


# inhouse - you are  a family member son/daughter 
# common public 
# audiance 
# patient 
# student 
 
# a function / method behaving differently based on the class



# abstraction: 
# showing neccesary things/ hiding the implementation details 



# class  Laptop:
#     brand="DELL"

#     def about(self):
#         return f"this is {self.brand} laptop"

# def about2():
#     return "hi"




# laptop1=Laptop()
# print(laptop1.brand)
# print(laptop1.about())













class Animal:
    speak=False 
    def walk():
        return f" i can walk"

dog=Animal()
print(dog)
print(dog.speak)
print(Animal.speak)
print(Animal.walk())
# print(dog.walk())
