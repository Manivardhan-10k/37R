data security 

1 -- encoding 
when the data is sent/transmit  
-> the data format is changed 


2  -- encryption 
when we are passing data 
--> we add additional data 
--> hello --> h8e5l12l12o15 (key) -> hello (key)  


3. hashing 
when we are storing the passwords  
->  hello ->  "hsfjkshfwgfhjksdhfjkhwegywer892r78924"  hashed password 
           method(password,hashed password)
